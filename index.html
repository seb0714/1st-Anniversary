            Happy 1st Anniversary love!<br /><br />

            I never imagined that we last this long, I never thought that someone will actually stay with me for a long time except for my mom HAHHAHAHAHA.
            At first, I was scared to tell you that I like you because I was afraid that you might not like me since you like my best friend that time. I still
            remember our first and most awkward meet. I still remember how obsessed you are with him that time, I never really wanted to confess my feelings for
            you, I never really wanted you to know that I fell in love with you the moment I saw you. I was embarrassed because you guys waited hours for us
            because of me.<br /><br />

            I will never forget all the things that you've done for me. I will never forget how nice you treated me when I can't forget my ex. You changed my
            whole life from being a total loser to a student who never ran out of energy coding and programming websites because of you. You gave me all the
            love and attention I needed. You never failed to reassure me, you never failed to show me how much you love me, you never failed to love me until
            this day.<br /><br />

            I still remember my first day going into your house, meeting your parents and your siblings. I still fondly remember our memories like the first
            swimming vacation with you and your family. I love you Angelica, so much. I love you so much more than myself, I can't even imagine my life
            without you.<br /><br />

            I'm scared because one day you might fall in love with another man who's better than me in any aspect. I'm afraid of you finding someone because I can't
            make you happy enough. I'm afraid that one day, you'll look for a new man to love you because I failed to show you how much I love you.<br /><br />

            I know I'm not good at expressing my feelings but just know that I'm always trying my best for you, Angelica ko. I love you so much, madam sungitt >.<br /><br />

            Again, Happy 1st Anniversary mahallll, I love you so muchhhhh pooooo!! :p More memories and away to comeee HAHAHAHAHAAH<br /><br />

            - Seb.
